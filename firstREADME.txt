boardgames, based off of webscraping of Boardgamegeek.com, which was performed 
using R.

The first of these folders, files, contains the end results of my scrapping.

The second, EDA, contains some of the early exploratory analysis of the data. 

The third, Scraping, contains the R scripts used to scrape boardgamegeek and 
create the files present in the files folder.

For additional information on each folder, see the readme files located in each.
