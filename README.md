# BGG_recommeder_Sprint_1
Repository containing the files from Sprint1 of my efforts to create a boardgame recommender system



These folders contained the files necessaary to create a recommender system for 
boardgames, based off of webscraping of Boardgamegeek.com, which was performed 
using R.

The first of these folders, **EDA**, contains some of the early exploratory analysis of the data.  

The second, **Files**, contains the end results of my scrapping, as well as my initial work with the data set(lab2(version2).R)

The third, **Scraping**, contains the R scripts used to scrape boardgamegeek and 
create the files present in the files folder.

For additional information on each folder, see the readme files located in each.

The original data for all boardgames can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gabrio/board-games-dataset)
