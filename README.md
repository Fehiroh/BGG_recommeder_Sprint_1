# BGG_recommeder_Sprint_1

Repository containing the files from Sprint1 of my efforts to create a boardgame recommender system

These folders contained the files necessaary to create a recommender system for 
boardgames, based off of webscraping of Boardgamegeek.com, which was performed 
using R.

 ## **EDA**
 contains some of the early exploratory analysis of the data.  

## **Files**
contains the end results of my scrapping, as well as my initial work with the data set(lab2(version2).R)

## **Scraping** 
contains the R scripts used to scrape boardgamegeek and create the files present in the files folder.



For additional information on each folder, see the readme files located in each.
